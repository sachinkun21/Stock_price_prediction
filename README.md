## Covering Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in Python and how we can use them to make predictions

In this Notebook, you will see how we can use a time-series model known as Long Short-Term Memory. LSTM models are powerful, especially for retaining a long-term memory, by design, as you will see later. You'll tackle the following topics in this tutorial:
- Understand why would you need to be able to predict stock price movements;
- Download the data - You will be using stock market data gathered from Yahoo finance;
- Split train-test data and also perform some data normalization;
- Go over and apply a few averaging techniques that can be used for one-step ahead predictions;
- Motivate and briefly discuss an LSTM model as it allows to predict more than one-step ahead;
- Predict and visualize future stock market with current data.
